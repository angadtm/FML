Find My Lease cloud computing project

Backend: Springboot
Frontend: Thymeleaf (same as basic html, but with different syntax)

1. Create firebase firestore db
2. Project setting -> service acc -> generate prv key
3. Save the json as "fsfbkey.json" and replace mine with yours in src/main/resources dir
4. Run the app and test


So far:

register user:  localhost:8080/register
register lease info: /lease
